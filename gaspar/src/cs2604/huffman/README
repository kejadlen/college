//	Project:	Project 3 - Huffman Coding

//	This set of programs uses a Huffman coding tree to encode
//  and decode files.

// On my honor:
//
// - I have not used C++ language code obtained from another student,
// or any other unauthorized source, either modified or unmodified.
//
// - All C++ language code and documentation used in my program
// is either my original work, or was derived, by me, from the source
// code published in the textbook for this course.
//
// - I have not discussed coding details about this project with anyone
// other than my instructor, ACM/UPE tutors or the GTAs assigned to this
// course. I understand that I may discuss the concepts of this program
// with other students, and that another student may help me debug my
// program so long as neither of us writes anything during the
// discussion or modifies any computer file during the discussion.
// I have violated neither the spirit nor letter of this restriction.
