* forgot the other ideas, though this was settled pretty quickly

* Meta
** cool idea, but no substance
* human remote control
** reverse control between human and computer (computer-human interaction?)

<blockquote>
Computer Human Interaction

People expect to control computers. What if this were turned around?

VR - people look around, their actions affect what they *see*. More immersive.

Environment can control the person. Visuals change, then the human remote control moves the person.

Probably not feasible to get/make a human remote control.
