Use a cardboard tube to direct sound from speaker

Fall back plan: headphones instead of directed sound

Hanging monitors or build a partition?
* if hanging, we can't hide speakers
  ** black drapery (curtain) to hide speakers?
  ** hanging monitors - something to hide speakers - speakers

Need to build a wall for the interactive part though.

Harrison:
  * Want original content. I.e., no stuff from Google Images, etc.

Content
  * Road trip!
  * Use budget to travel to get images!
  * Issue of copyright?
    ** Ask for permission to use images?
    ** Why should we avoid using Google Images?

Materials
  * Displays
  * Video camera
  * Cables
    ** for hanging displays
    ** also normal cables for connecting stuff
  * Sound system
  * Frame for displays
    ** build a frame?
    ** hang from ceiling?
    ** 10' length (see below)
  * Computers (4-8 computers)
  * Lighting

Get construction started *early*

How mobile will the piece need to be? 
  * in terms of building it, can we build it in the installation or will we have to move it there?

17" monitors
  * 13.6" x 10.2"
  * Give a bezel of 1", we'll need about 9'4" assuming the monitors are all side by side.

So make the frame 10' so we have room to play with.

Ira: How about using the new iMacs?
  * makes life much easier
    ** only need power coming out!
  * can we take the mount off and use a different mount?
  * 17" x 17"

Ben: How about using pedestals instead of hanging the displays?
  * can add front-to-back depth
  * don't need to worry about a frame

Hossanah: Drop water down fishing wires? Water fountains of fishing wire?
  * Have water in the background running down?

Ben: Frame/structure problems.

Ira: Maybe transparent rods would provide the structure with more support.

Kunmi: Use a wall and shelves?
